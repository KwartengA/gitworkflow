** IN THIS PROJECT, I AM PROVIDED WITH A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE RED WINE DATASET. I FOLLOWED USING THE OBJECTED-ORIENTED APPROACH TO PERFORM EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS.**
### SECTION I:

1. I created a folder and named it with my index number
2. Copied the modified red_wine.csv dataset into the folder
3. Started a Jupyter Notebook Server using the Command Prompt Interface

### SECTION II:

In the Jupyter Notebook environment, I wrote the code needed to perform the following tasks:

1.	Using markdown, I provided my name, index number, and class
2.	Installed and imported the following Python Libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
3. Imported the modified red_wine.csv dataset into my working notebook environment
4. Previewed the first 10 rows using the head method
5.	Previewed the last 20 rows using the tail method
6.	Utilized the info method to check basic information on the dataset
7.	Used the describe method to obtain statistical information on the dataset.
8.	Deployed all manner of skills and techniques including graphs and plots to obtain meaningful insight from the dataset.
9.	Used markdown to report on all plots and graphs obtained. 

### SECTION III:

1.	I then created a local Git repository and committed my work to the repository.
2.	I created a remote GitHub repository and committed my work to the remote repository. 
3.	Copied the link of your remote GitHub repository and included it in the appropriate section in the Google form.
